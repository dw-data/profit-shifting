## Data source
The data for this story comes from the  [Atlas of the Offshore World](https://atlas-offshore.world/), published by the EU Tax Observatory, as well as from their most recent report on tax evasion.


## Code structure
In this repository, all the source data files can be found on the `data` directory, which contains the source file for all figures in the story.

Both the data processing required to make the charts and the data analysis can be found in the `code` directory. The notebook `taxes-won` dives into the profits shifted to tax havens, while the notebook `taxes-lost` does the same for the countries where profits were shifted from.

Finally, the CSV files used for making the charts are available in the `output` directory.
